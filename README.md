# Discord Script Searcher Bot

This Discord bot allows users to search for scripts using the `!search` command or the slash command `/search` followed by a query. Users can specify the search mode as `free` or `paid`. The bot retrieves script information from the [ScriptBlox API](https://github.com/DocsGuy/Unoffical-Scriptblox-api-docs) and [Rscripts API](https://api.rscripts.net/) and displays the results.

## Features

- **Multi-API Search**: Choose between ScriptBlox and Rscripts APIs for script searches.
- **Dual Command**: Use both prefix commands (`!search`) and slash commands (`/search`) for searching.
- **Script Information**: Displays title, game name, script type, views, verified status, key requirement, creation and update dates, script content and etc.
- **Navigation and Interaction**: Navigate through search results with interactive buttons for easy browsing.
- **Improved Help Command**: Easy guide on using both prefix and slash commands.

## Commands

- `!search <query> [mode]`: Search for scripts using a prefix command. Example: `!search arsenal paid`.
- `/search <query> [mode]`: Search for scripts using a slash command. Example: `/search arsenal paid`.
- `!bothelp`: Display help information about using the bot.
- `/bothelp`: Display help information using the slash command.
